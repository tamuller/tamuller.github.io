    <h1>Rates</h1>

    <p>You can reserve directly with us and avoid paying the hefty service fees
      charged by vacation-rental platforms.</p>

    <p>We have a four-night minimum. For two people, we charge $200 per night on
      Friday and Saturday nights. On weekdays, we charge $175 per night.</p>

    <p>For every additional person, we charge an additional $20 per night, up to
      a maximum of five people.</p>

    <p>Our house is not suitable for parents with small children, because the
      master suite of our house is two floors away from the lower-level suite.</p>

    <p>And sorry, but we can't allow pets because so many of our other guests
      are allergic to them.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in reserving a stay, <a href="#" id="ctct">please contact us</a>. Please
      include the names and ages of everyone who will be staying. Thanks!</p>

    <h2>What to know</h2>

    <p>Check-in is by keypad, starting at 3 p.m. Check-out is at 11 a.m except
      on Sundays and holidays, when it is 2 p.m.</p>

    <p>Be sure to bring warm clothes for your forays down to the lake, which
      generally is 10 degrees
      cooler but sometimes feels 30 degrees cooler because of the breezes.</p>

    <p>We have filled the benches in our entry with all kinds of hiker
      accessories — water bottles,
      sunblock, insect repellent, umbrellas, rain ponchos — and our guests are
      welcome to use
      them.</p>

    <p>We have left maps and a notebook full of recommendations for fun things
      to do. Your hosts
      while you are in Duluth will be our next-door neighbors and good friends,
      Rod and Jackie.
      They'll be happy to help with whatever you need.</p>

    <h2>House rules</h2>

    <p>We don't allow additional guests unless approved in advance by the host,
      nor do we allow parties or any other event.</p>

    <p>We don't allow smoking or vaping anywhere on our property.</p>

    <p>Our house is in a quiet residential neighborhood, so please respect our
      neighbors and keep noise down, especially after 10 p.m.</p>

    <h2>About us</h2>

    <p>We love the outdoors, especially hiking, bicycling, kayaking and
      cross-country skiing.
      Because Duluth is such a fantastic place to do those things, we bought a
      house and spent
      nearly every weekend there when we lived in Minneapolis.</p>

    <p>Now, we want our guests to enjoy Duluth as much as we did (and still do,
      just not as often).</p>

    <p>We also operate an online travel guide to the western Great Lakes,
      <a href="https://midwestweekends.com/">MidwestWeekends.com</a>. Our
      website's slogan is “Life's Too Short to Stay Home.'' That's our personal
      slogan, too.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your interest in our home!</p>

    <p>– Beth Gauper and Torsten Müller</p>
